# Rainmeter TextToSpeech Plugin

This is a Rainmeter plugin (`TextToSpeech.dll`) that allows users to convert text into speech using installed voices on your system. It can be triggered by clicking a Rainmeter skin element, making it interactive for various purposes like notifications, reminders, or accessibility features.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech functionality**: Converts a given text into speech using a specified voice.
- **Customizable voices**: Choose from the installed voices on your system (e.g., "Microsoft David Desktop", "Microsoft Zira Desktop").
- **Interactive skins**: Trigger speech by clicking on a Rainmeter skin element.
- **Supports any text**: You can specify any text for speech output in the Rainmeter skin.

## Installation

1. **Download/Clone the Plugin**:
   - Download or clone the plugin from this repository.
   - Compile the plugin (`TextToSpeech.dll`) and place it in your Rainmeter `Plugins` folder. The typical path is:
     ```
     Documents\Rainmeter\Plugins
     ```

2. **Create a Rainmeter Skin**:
   - In your Rainmeter skin folder (e.g., `Documents\Rainmeter\Skins`), create a new folder for the skin (e.g., `TestTextToSpeech`).
   - Save the provided `TextToSpeech` example `.ini` file into your skin folder.

3. **Configure the Skin**:
   - Customize the `TextToSpeech.ini` file to specify the text you want to be spoken and the voice you want to use.
   - You can adjust the voice by modifying the `Voice` parameter in the `[TextToSpeech]` measure. Ensure you use a valid installed voice, such as `"Microsoft David Desktop"` or `"Microsoft Zira Desktop"`.

## Example Skin

Here is an example `.ini` skin to test the Text-to-Speech plugin:

```ini
[Rainmeter]
Update=1000
BackgroundMode=2
SolidColor=000000

[TextToSpeech]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=TextToSpeech.dll
Text="This is a test of Text-to-Speech."
Voice="Microsoft David Desktop"

[TextToSpeechTrigger]
Meter=String
MeasureName=TextToSpeech
X=10
Y=10
W=300
H=30
FontColor=FFFFFF
FontSize=14
Text="Click here to hear speech!"
LeftMouseUpAction=[!RainmeterPluginBang "TextToSpeech ExecuteBatch 1"]

[Instructions]
Meter=String
X=10
Y=50
W=300
H=30
FontColor=FFFFFF
FontSize=12
Text="Click the above text to hear the speech in the selected voice."

[DebugInfo]
Meter=String
X=10
Y=90
FontColor=FFFFFF
FontSize=10
Text="Voice: %1"
UpdateDivider=1000
MeasureName=TextToSpeech
```

## Usage

1. **Activate the Skin**:
   - Open Rainmeter and load the skin you created (e.g., `TestTextToSpeech`).
   
2. **Trigger Speech**:
   - You will see the text `"Click here to hear speech!"` in the skin.
   - When you click this text, the plugin will trigger speech and read the text `"This is a test of Text-to-Speech."` using the selected voice.

3. **Customize**:
   - You can customize the text, font size, and color in the Rainmeter skin, as well as change the voice to any of your installed voices by modifying the `Voice` parameter.

## Troubleshooting

- **No sound?** Ensure your speakers or headphones are properly connected, and the volume is not muted.
- **Voice not found?** Make sure you have the required voice installed on your system. You can install additional voices from the Windows settings.
  - Go to `Settings > Time & Language > Speech > Manage voices` to add voices.
